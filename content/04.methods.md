To contribute to this document, check out this [tutorial video](https://manubot.org/docs/getting-started.html). Then:

1. Go to the project's underlying [GitHub directory](https://github.com/jperkel/mymanuscript).
2. 'Fork' a copy of the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the Fork icon at the top of the page.
3. In your copy of the repository, navigate to the `content` subdirectory.
4. Click any document file to open it (these are the files whose names begin with numbers, eg `00.front-matter.md`, `01.abstract.md`, ...). In the gray bar above the document text is a toolbar; select the pencil icon to edit the file. Make your suggested changes. 
5. At the bottom of the page, where it says "Commit changes", add an optional comment, and select 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.' The software will suggest a new name for this branch, like `jperkel-patch-1`; you can change that if you'd like.
6. Click "Propose file change". 
7. In the resulting web page, entitled "Open a pull request", click "Create pull request". 
8. You're done!
